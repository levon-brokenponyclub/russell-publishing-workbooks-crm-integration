   - Refactored `lead-generation-handler.php` to match the robust logic of the webinar handler.
   - Now checks for the presence of a `mailing_list_id` before attempting ticket or mailing list creation.

## Handler & Submission Process Updates (v1.4.5)

### üõ†Ô∏è Unified Submission Handlers

- **Ninja Forms Handler** (`includes/ninja-forms-simple-hook.php`):
   - Catches all Ninja Forms submissions for both webinars and lead generation.
   - Distinguishes between webinar forms (ID 2) and lead gen forms (ID 31), routing each to the correct process.
   - Extracts and normalizes all relevant fields, including dynamic ACF fields, sponsor opt-in, and speaker questions.
   - Ensures all actions are logged with a unique submission/debug ID for traceability.

- **Webinar Registration Handler** (`includes/webinar-handler.php`):
   - Handles the full registration process for webinars, including:
      1. Validating required data (post ID, email, etc.)
      2. Resolving event references and extracting event IDs
      3. Creating or updating the person in Workbooks CRM
      4. Creating or updating the event ticket
      5. **Mailing List Queue:** Adds or updates the participant in the event's mailing list, including sponsor opt-in and speaker questions
      6. Logs every step and error for debugging
   - Uses a robust debug logger to write to both the PHP error log and a dedicated plugin log file (`logs/gated-post-submissions-debug.log`).
   - All failures and successes are clearly logged, with detailed debug reports for each submission.

### üì¨ Mailing List Queue Logic

- After successful ticket creation, the handler checks for a mailing list associated with the event.
- If a mailing list entry for the participant exists, it is updated (including sponsor opt-in and speaker questions); otherwise, a new entry is created.
- All mailing list actions are logged, and exceptions are handled gracefully with detailed error output.

### üìù Debug Logging & Error Handling
- **Lead Generation Debug Log**: All lead generation actions, including extracted ACF questions and field values, are now logged to `lead-generation-debug.log` for full traceability.

- Every submission (webinar or lead) is assigned a unique debug ID for tracking.
- All major steps (person creation, ticket creation, mailing list update) are logged with timestamps and context.
- Errors and exceptions are captured and included in the debug report, making troubleshooting much easier.

### üîÑ Submission Flow (Webinar Example)

1. **Form Submission:** User submits a Ninja Form (webinar or lead gen)
2. **Handler Routing:** Form is routed to the correct handler based on form ID
3. **Data Extraction:** All fields (including ACF, sponsor opt-in, questions) are extracted and normalized
4. **Person Sync:** Person is created or updated in Workbooks CRM
5. **Ticket Creation:** Event ticket is created/updated for the person
6. **Mailing List Update:** Participant is added/updated in the event's mailing list with all relevant info
7. **Debug Logging:** Every step, success, and error is logged with a unique debug ID
