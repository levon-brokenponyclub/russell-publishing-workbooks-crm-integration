## Webinar Registration Template Logic Reference

### Logic Overview

#### 1. Webinar Type Detection
- If the ACF field `webinar_link` is present, the post is treated as an **On Demand Webinar**.
- Otherwise, it is a **Live Webinar** (date-based logic applies).

#### 2. User State Logic
- **Not logged in:**
   - Show a "Register Now" button that triggers the login modal.
- **Logged in:**
   - **On Demand Webinar (webinar_link present):**
      - Show "On Demand - Register Now" button.
      - If `add_additional_questions` is true and a form is set, display the Ninja Form below.
   - **Live Webinar (upcoming event, not on demand):**
      - If user is already registered:
         - Show "Registered" button and calendar link.
      - If user is not registered:
         - Show "Register Now" button (no link).
         - Display the Ninja Form below if set.
   - **Live Webinar (event has passed, not on demand):**
      - Show "On Demand - Register Now" button.
      - If `add_additional_questions` is true and a form is set, display the Ninja Form below.

#### 3. Logging
- Console logs are output at each major logic branch to identify webinar type and user state for debugging.
- PHP comments and section titles are used throughout the template for maintainability.

#### 4. Future Extensions
- Placeholder for JS logging/debug code is kept for future use.
- Logic is modular and clearly commented for easy adaptation to Lead Generation or other flows.

## Installation & Setup

1. Copy the plugin directory to `/wp-content/plugins/dtr-workbooks-crm-integration/`.
2. Activate the plugin via WordPress Admin → Plugins.
3. Configure API settings: Plugins → Workbooks CRM (API URL, API Key). Save.
4. Set `debug_mode` in plugin settings only when troubleshooting (see Debugging section).

### Requirements

- WordPress 5.0+  
- PHP 7.4+  
- cURL extension  
- Ninja Forms (optional, required for Ninja Forms features)  
- Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for gated content features

## Configuration

- API URL / API Key: enter under plugin settings.  
- Debug Mode: toggle under plugin settings. When enabled the plugin will write admin debug files in `admin/` (see notes below). In production, keep debug_mode disabled.


## Debugging & Logs

### Common Issue: Function Argument Error

**Issue:**
You may see an error stating that the function `dtr_register_workbooks_webinar` is defined to require at least 2 arguments, but it is being called with only one (an array).

**Fix:**
Update the call so that all required arguments are passed individually, matching the function signature. Do not pass a single array; instead, provide each argument as expected by the function. This resolves the fatal error.

- Main plugin logs are located in:
  - `wp-content/plugins/dtr-workbooks-crm-integration/logs/` (daily API and operational logs)
  - `wp-content/plugins/dtr-workbooks-crm-integration/admin/connection-debug.log` (connection tests) — written only if `debug_mode` = true
  - `wp-content/plugins/dtr-workbooks-crm-integration/admin/update-debug.log` (person update payloads/responses/verify fetches) — written only if `debug_mode` = true

- Important: debug logs are gated. To enable admin debug logs, set plugin option `dtr_workbooks_options['debug_mode'] = true` via settings or admin UI. This avoids noisy logs in production.

- Archival on disable: When `debug_mode` is turned off via the plugin settings, any existing admin debug logs in the `admin/` folder are moved to `admin/archive/` with a timestamped filename (so you keep historical logs without exposing them in the webroot).

## Usage Guide

### Gated Content & Ninja Forms Integration
**Form & Field Setup**
* Attach ACF field group to any gated content post type (webinar, report, whitepaper, etc.)
* Add / modify fields – forms adapt automatically (no manual Ninja Forms edits)
* Standard core + marketing + AOI/TOI + employer fields are auto-recognized

**Registration Process**
1. User submits dynamic form
2. (Optional) WordPress user created / updated
3. Fields mapped & sanitized → Workbooks person create/update
4. Sales Lead always created
5. Ticket / mailing list updated when event context present
6. Debug logs written (if enabled)

### Person Record Management
Supported key field categories:
* Personal: title, first name, last name, job title
* Contact: email, telephone, country, town, postcode
* Employer: free‑text employer name resolved to organisation (created if absent)
* Preferences: marketing/news/events/webinars/third‑party
* AOI/TOI: business, diseases, drugs & therapies, genomics, R&D, technology, tools & techniques

Example Mapping Snippet:
```php
'person_personal_title' => 'person_personal_title',
'employer_name'         => 'employer_name',
'cf_person_aoi_biomarkers' => 'cf_person_biomarkers',
'cf_person_aoi_genomics'   => 'cf_person_genomics',
```

### Employer Synchronization
Automatic Sync Features:
* Daily cron & manual trigger
* Batch API retrieval → DB table + transient + regenerated JSON
* Select2 endpoint reads from DB (paged) – JSON fallback for legacy code paths

Sync Steps:
1. Fetch batches from Workbooks
2. Upsert into table
3. Write JSON (new path + fallback)
4. Update transient & last sync data

### Webinar & Content Registration Flow
1. User selects gated content / event
2. ACF metadata (event IDs, sponsor, questions) loaded
3. Submission handled by unified pipeline
4. Person + ticket + lead operations executed
5. Logging & optional verification fetch

### My Account Updates
* Frontend changes immediately synced to Workbooks
* Admin preference edits mirrored back to user meta (keeps UI consistent)

### Debugging Workflow (Typical)
1. Enable debug mode (settings)
2. Reset daily log
3. Perform test submission (capture debug ID)
4. Review specialized + daily logs
5. Disable debug mode post‑diagnosis

---

### Logging Helpers
* `dtr_admin_log($message, $file)` – gated by debug mode
* Daily operational log – automatic append (naming pattern `dtr-workbooks-YYYY-MM-DD.log`)

Enable Debug Mode programmatically (optional):
```php
update_option('dtr_workbooks_options', array_merge(
   get_option('dtr_workbooks_options', []),
   ['debug_mode' => true]
));
```
Disable afterward to reduce I/O.

## Deployment
* Scripts in `scripts/` (setup, deploy, post-commit sync) – optional CI
* Ensure permissions allow writing to `logs/` and `assets/json/`



## Changelog (Highlights)

## 🖕 Handler & Submission Process Updates (v1.4.6)

- **Lead Generation Handler Overhaul:**
   - Refactored `lead-generation-handler.php` to match the robust logic of the webinar handler.
   - Now checks for the presence of a `mailing_list_id` before attempting ticket or mailing list creation.
   - If no `mailing_list_id` is present, the handler skips ticket/mailing list creation but still returns success, improving flexibility for non-mailing-list forms.
   - Modularized mailing list upsert logic for maintainability and code reuse.
   - Improved error handling and debug logging throughout the lead gen process.
   - All lead gen actions are now logged to `lead-generation-debug.log` with unique debug IDs for traceability.

- **Modular Handler Improvements:**
   - Unified and modularized form handler logic for both webinars and lead generation.
   - Improved dynamic field extraction and mapping using ACF and Ninja Forms meta.
   - Ensured all handlers use `require_once`/`include_once` to prevent function redeclaration errors.


## Handler & Submission Process Updates (v1.4.5)

### 🛠️ Unified Submission Handlers

- **Ninja Forms Handler** (`includes/ninja-forms-simple-hook.php`):
   - Catches all Ninja Forms submissions for both webinars and lead generation.
   - Distinguishes between webinar forms (ID 2) and lead gen forms (ID 31), routing each to the correct process.
   - Extracts and normalizes all relevant fields, including dynamic ACF fields, sponsor opt-in, and speaker questions.
   - Ensures all actions are logged with a unique submission/debug ID for traceability.

- **Webinar Registration Handler** (`includes/webinar-handler.php`):
   - Handles the full registration process for webinars, including:
      1. Validating required data (post ID, email, etc.)
      2. Resolving event references and extracting event IDs
      3. Creating or updating the person in Workbooks CRM
      4. Creating or updating the event ticket
      5. **Mailing List Queue:** Adds or updates the participant in the event's mailing list, including sponsor opt-in and speaker questions
      6. Logs every step and error for debugging
   - Uses a robust debug logger to write to both the PHP error log and a dedicated plugin log file (`logs/gated-post-submissions-debug.log`).
   - All failures and successes are clearly logged, with detailed debug reports for each submission.

### 📬 Mailing List Queue Logic

- After successful ticket creation, the handler checks for a mailing list associated with the event.
- If a mailing list entry for the participant exists, it is updated (including sponsor opt-in and speaker questions); otherwise, a new entry is created.
- All mailing list actions are logged, and exceptions are handled gracefully with detailed error output.

### 📝 Debug Logging & Error Handling
- **Lead Generation Debug Log**: All lead generation actions, including extracted ACF questions and field values, are now logged to `lead-generation-debug.log` for full traceability.

- Every submission (webinar or lead) is assigned a unique debug ID for tracking.
- All major steps (person creation, ticket creation, mailing list update) are logged with timestamps and context.
- Errors and exceptions are captured and included in the debug report, making troubleshooting much easier.

### 🔄 Submission Flow (Webinar Example)

1. **Form Submission:** User submits a Ninja Form (webinar or lead gen)
2. **Handler Routing:** Form is routed to the correct handler based on form ID
3. **Data Extraction:** All fields (including ACF, sponsor opt-in, questions) are extracted and normalized
4. **Person Sync:** Person is created or updated in Workbooks CRM
5. **Ticket Creation:** Event ticket is created/updated for the person
6. **Mailing List Update:** Participant is added/updated in the event's mailing list with all relevant info
7. **Debug Logging:** Every step, success, and error is logged with a unique debug ID

## Changelog

### 2025-09-09
**Admin Webinar System Overhaul & Debugging Enhancements**
- Moved the admin-side webinar registration test form into the plugin admin area for robust, repeatable testing.
- Test form now uses hardcoded, controlled values for all fields, including person_id, to ensure consistent results.
- All field names and values are logged to the browser console and backend debug log for every submission.
- Handler updated to use the submitted person_id if present, matching legacy field structure and debug output format.
- Enforced array-wrapped pattern for all Workbooks API calls in the webinar handler for consistency and reliability.
- Ticket creation and all registration steps are now fully logged in the dedicated debug log (`admin/admin-webinar-debug.log` or `includes/webinar-debug.log`).
- Debug output now matches legacy format, making it easier to compare with previous logs and troubleshoot issues.
- All changes validated: registration, ticket creation, and debug output confirmed working end-to-end.

**UI/UX Improvements & Save for Later**
- Save button text now changes to "Saved" when a post is saved, and reverts if removed.
- Users can add a personal note when saving a post to their collection.
- Saved posts and notes are visible in the "My Account" section for later viewing.
- All save/remove/note actions are AJAX-powered for instant feedback.
