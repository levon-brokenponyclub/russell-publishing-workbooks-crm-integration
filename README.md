## üöÄ Overview & Core Features

### üîó **Core CRM Integration**
- **API Integration**: Secure connection to Workbooks CRM using API keys with timeout and error handling
- **Person Record Management**: Create, update, and sync person records with comprehensive field mapping
- **Employer Synchronization**: Intelligent employer matching and organization management
- **Duplicate Detection**: Smart duplicate checking using email matching with Workbooks API
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed debug logs for troubleshooting and monitoring

### üìù **Gated Content Enhancements & Microanimation Additions**
- **üîê Enhanced Gated Content**: Dynamic gated content generation based on post type. Streamlined content access tied to CRM campaign tracking.

- **üë§ Account Management**: Customizable dashboards for users to manage their profiles and preferences. Full integration of CRM-linked user data within WordPress accounts.

### ü•∑ **Advanced Ninja Forms & ACF-Powered Gated Content Integration**
- **Real-Time ACF Answer Logging**: The frontend now logs ACF question answers to the browser console in real time as users interact with the form, including dropdowns, checkboxes, radios, and text fields.
- **Post ID & Campaign Logging**: The script logs the current `post_id` (and `campaign` if present) alongside ACF answers, ensuring these hidden fields are always visible in the console for debugging and validation.
- **Robust Field Detection**: Improved JavaScript logic to reliably find hidden fields (like `post_id`) both globally and inside the Ninja Form, so values are always logged even if the form structure changes.
- **Backend Handler Improvements**: The lead generation handler and Ninja Forms hook were updated to ensure that ACF questions (from the `add_questions` field) are always extracted, merged, and logged, and that all lead generation actions are written to `lead-generation-debug.log`.
- **Parse Error Fixes**: Fixed PHP parse errors in the ACF question rendering logic by moving array mapping outside of inline echo statements and using `isset()` for compatibility.
- **Automatic User Creation**: Seamlessly create WordPress users from form submissions
- **CRM Record Creation**: Automatically generate corresponding Workbooks person records
- **Dynamic Form Generation**: Forms for gated content are now generated based on ACF fields within any post type (webinars, reports, whitepapers, etc.), minimizing manual form edits and maintenance
- **Flexible Mapping**: All ACF fields (including event/campaign references, questions, sponsor opt-in, etc.) are mapped and synchronized to Workbooks CRM
- **Field Mapping**: Complete mapping of all form fields to CRM equivalents, including:
  - Personal titles (Dr., Mr., Mrs., Ms., Prof., etc.)
  - Contact information (name, email, telephone, address)
  - Employment details with editable employer names
  - Marketing preferences and subscription settings
  - Topics of Interest (TOI) to Areas of Interest (AOI) mapping
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with detailed logging and recovery mechanisms

### üìö **Universal Gated Content Integration (Webinars & More)**
- **Dynamic ACF Question Handling**: All ACF questions defined on the post are now merged and passed to the backend, and are visible in both the frontend console and backend debug logs for every submission.
- **All Gated Content Supported**: Handles webinars, reports, whitepapers, and any other ACF-powered gated content post type
- **ACF-Driven Registration**: All critical event/campaign references, questions, and dynamic fields are defined and managed via ACF on the content itself
- **Zero-Edit Forms**: When you add or update a field in the ACF group for a gated post, your registration form adapts automatically
- **Lead and Ticket Automation**: Submissions always create a Workbooks person, event ticket (when relevant), and a new sales lead‚Äîensuring all engagement is tracked

### üéØ **Topics of Interest & Areas of Interest**
